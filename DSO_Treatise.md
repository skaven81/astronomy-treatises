A Treatise on Optimizing DSO Observation
===============================

## Preface

After writing [A Treatise on Optimizing Planetary Views](Planetary_Treatise.md), I was asked to
write up something similar for DSO observation.  What follows here is my best attempt to consolidate
the information I've accumulated through this forum, other resources online, and my own experience,
into a straightforward document describing how to get the most out of your telescope when trying to
observe those elusive "faint fuzzies".

You may find that there is some duplication of advice here and in the Planetary Observation
document.  However, I encourage you to read through the sections thoroughly, because there may be
subtle changes from one to the other since observing planets is, in a lot of ways, very different
from observing DSOs.

I would like to emphasize that I am NOT a professional astronomer; I do NOT have a degree in
astrophysics; I am NOT a seasoned veteran behind the scope.  So while I will do my best to make sure
that the topics I present are factually correct, I may make some mistakes!  I encourage you to do
your own research: don't take my word as the final say.  If you do find factual errors, please note
them in the comments and I'll work with a moderator to correct them in this post.

Finally, try to keep an open mind.  A lot of the information I present in this document is
subjective -- it's stuff that might work great for me, but may not work so well for others.  If you
find that a tool or technique I've presented in this document are not effective, it doesn't mean
you're "doing it wrong", it just means you've found a technique that doesn't suit you.  Explore your
options and come up with your own, personalized process for DSO observation that makes *you*
happy.

Thank you for reading, and a huge thanks to the hundreds of kind forum members who have helped me
learn the ropes to such a degree that I feel confident writing this document.

## Introduction

The first targets that tend to be observed by a budding amateur astronomer are the nearby planets.
And for good reason: they're bright enough to be seen from even the brightest urban areas, they show
incredible detail and color, and they are observed using high magnification, which feels appropriate
for many new telescope owners, who feel like the ability to "zoom in" is the primary feature of
their scope.

But the fact is, there are only seven planets we can observe with amateur equipment (Mercury, Venus,
Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune), and of those, only three (Mars, Jupiter, Saturn) show any
interesting detail on the surface.  Not to say that planetary observation can get "boring" -- quite
the opposite -- but it *can* get a bit repetitive, especially when there is only one
"interesting" planet in a favorable viewing position.

It's at this point that most astronomers will look to observe objects that lie outside our Solar
System: so-called "Deep Space Objects" or "DSOs".  There are literally *billions* of observable
DSOs out there.  OK, so the number that are readily observable visually in amateur equipment
probably number in the thousands.  But still -- the level of variety and sheer quantity of DSOs
ensures that a sufficiently motivated amateur astronomer will never run out of new things to see.

What I will try to do with this document is to guide you through the rich world of DSOs in such a
way that you come away confident in your ability to observe them.  I've broken the document into
several sections that should, more or less, be in a reasonable order to ensure that you don't come
across a topic in an earlier section that is explained in a later section.


*  **DSO Classifications** - What are the different types of DSOs?  What are they, what properties do they have, and what do they look like in a typical amateur telescope?
*  **Choosing the Right Telescope** - There is no one telescope that "does it all".  So what properties of each type of telescope contribute to effective observation of each kind of DSO?
*  **Choosing the Right Eyepieces** - Observing DSOs often requires subtle tweaks to magnification to get the best view.  What properties should you look for in your eyepieces to get the  best DSO views?
*  **Choosing the Right Filters** - Filters can help draw detail from otherwise featureless smudges, or even make some objects appear that were invisible before.  What filters can be used to help observing, and how?

## DSO Classifications

Before diving into the details of the best way to observe DSOs, it's important to understand the
differences in the types of DSOs.  Each type has unique features that introduce different challenges
when observing them.

## **Double Stars**

The simplest type of DSO is the humble double (or triple, or more!) star.  The main feature of a
double star is that to the naked eye, it appears to be a single star, but is revealed to have
multiple components when observed with optical aid.  There are two types: **star systems**, where
the stars actually orbit each other, and an **optical double**, where the stars only appear to be
close to each other due to the line of sight.

Double stars are a great way to test the limits of your telescope optics, as well as the seeing
conditions at your site.  Many are also brilliantly colored, sometimes with the components having
strikingly different colorations.  In general, there are two objectives when observing doubles: 1)
to "split" the double [to resolve both components as separate points of light], and 2) to observe
the difference in color and brightness of the pair.

Many double stars can be split with a pair of 10x50 binoculars, but most require a telescope.  
[Dawes' Limit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dawes'_limit) defines the minimum apparent distance between two stars that are resolvable.  This limit scales linearly with telescope aperture: in other words,
splitting tighter doubles requires a larger aperture telescope.

Some fine examples of double stars are Beta Cygni (Albireo), Epsilon Lyrae (the Double Double), and
Alpha Geminorum (Castor).

## **Open Clusters**

Open clusters are collections of stars that formed in the same stellar nursery at the same time, and
move through the galaxy as a group.  The component stars are loosely gravitationally bound to each
other, and thus they are easily disrupted by passing objects.  As a result, most open clusters have
a lifetime of only a few hundred million years.

Visually, open clusters appear as a dim smudge of light "behind" the surrounding smattering of
stars, when viewed at low power, such as in a finder or binocular.  At moderate magnification, open
clusters are easily resolved into their component stars.  Many open clusters are named after objects
that the component stars appear to form.  For example, M44, aka "the Beehive Cluster", looks to many
observers like a beehive hanging from the branch of a tree.  Open clusters can be fun to observe for
the colors (NGC 4755, the "Jewel Box Cluster") and/or for the shapes the stars form (M11, the "Wild
Duck Cluster").  My wife and I enjoy observing open clusters together and comparing what we "see" in
the stars.

Open clusters are found throughout the Milky Way and vary greatly in apparent size and brightness.
One of the largest and brightest open clusters is M45, the Pleiades.  It is nearly 2 degrees in
diameter and has an apparent magnitude of 1.6.  It is easily visible to the naked eye even under
light polluted skies.  At the other end of the spectrum, there are open clusters so dim and small
that they can be difficult to pick out from the surrounding stars.  An example of a small, dim
cluster is M26, just 15' in diameter and magnitude 8.

## **Globular Clusters**

Globular clusters are distinct from open clusters in that they are much more tightly packed, are
tightly gravitationally bound, and tend to be very, very old.  In fact, most globular clusters
contain stars that were formed around the same time as our own galaxy!  They orbit in the "halo" of
the galaxy, far away from the core.  Surprisingly little is known about how globular clusters form.

You can see the difference between an open and a globular cluster immediately upon observing a glob.
While open clusters are sparse and scattered, with well-defined space between each component,
globular clusters are packed so tight that they appear as a spherical fuzzball, getting brighter
toward the center.  Their distance from us combined with the tight packing of their component stars
makes resolving the individual stars in the cluster difficult without fairly large instruments.

Unlike open clusters, most globular clusters appear pretty much the same.  Careful observation can
reveal unique features in each glob: this can be a fun aspect of observing them.  Much like double
star observation, observing globs can be a great way to test the limits of your optics and sky
conditions, by seeing how "deep" into the cluster you are able to resolve individual stars.  The
largest globular clusters are around 30 arcminutes in diameter; most are quite a bit smaller than
that.

Some excellent examples of globular clusters are M13 (Great Hercules Cluster), M22 (one of the
brightest globs in the sky), and Omega Centauri (the largest and brightest glob in the Milky Way).

## **Emission & Reflection Nebulae**

In between all the billions of stars in our galaxy is an immense amount of gas and dust.  In some
regions, the gas and dust is clumped together more densely than in other areas.  Often these dense
clumps collapse in on themselves due to gravitation and form stars.  These clumps of gas and dust
are collectively called "nebulae" and fall into three visual categories:

**Dark Nebulae** are clouds of dust that are invisible except that they happen to block the light
from stars behind them from reaching us here on Earth.  These nebulae appear like "ink blots"
against rich star fields.  Since they are not illuminated themselves, very little detail can be
observed in them, except to trace their boundaries.

**Reflection Nebulae** are glouds of gas and dust that become visible to us on Earth due to the
light of a nearby star (or stars) reflecting off.  These nebulae can be striking and beautiful, and
some observers (particularly young ones) have occasionally reported being able to see colors in them
through the eyepiece.

**Emission Nebulae** are similar to reflection nebulae, except that instead of light reflecting
off of them, they absorb energy from a nearby star.  That absorbed energy causes gases in the nebula
to become excited and radiate light on very specific spectral lines.  This is an important
distinction, because while reflection nebulae are visible across most or all of the spectrum,
emission nebulae are often only emitting light on a few narrow slivers of the spectrum.

Nebulae vary wildly in apparent dimensions.  Large nebulae like M42 (Orion Nebula) and M8 (Lagoon
Nebula) can be 2 degrees or more in apparent diameter, while other nebulae such as M17 (Swan Nebula)
are as small as 10 arcminutes.  Since their light is often quite faint and spread over a large area,
they are very sensitive to the effects of light pollution.

## **Planetary Nebulae**

The term "planetary nebula" is a bit of a misnomer.  They are definitely not planets, but when
William Herschel viewed them through his telescope, they appeared to resemble Uranus, which had
recently been discovered.  In reality, planetary nebulae are brightly lit shells of ionized gas
being thrown off of a dying star.  They come in a myriad of shapes and sizes, but all have a central
star.

Astrophotos of planetary nebulae can be incredibly beautiful.  The ionized gases form lots of
different colors, and the nebulae often demonstrate interesting symmetry.  Visually, however, most
planetaries do not give up much detail.  All planetary nebulae appear in grayscale in a typical
amateur telescope, and with few exceptions (M57 [Ring Nebula], M27 [Dumbbell Nebula], etc.) appear
as a "fuzzy star" rather than the glorious detail seen in photos.  However, this does not make them
any less interesting to observe visually!  Their similar appearance to surrounding stars can make
them quite difficult to locate, and so definitely identifying them in your eyepiece can be a unique
thrill even if you don't see anything spectacular in the object itself.  Owners of very large
telescopes may challenge themselves to visually observe the central star in a planetary nebula.

While some planetary nebulae can be enormous in size (the Veil Nebula in Cygnus is a whopping three
degrees in diameter), the vast majority are under 30 arcminutes, and at least half are under 60
arcseconds.

Some wonderful examples of planetary nebulae are M57 (Ring Nebula), M27 (Dumbbell Nebula),
and M76 (Little Dumbbell Nebula).  All three of these planetary nebulae will exhibit easily
discernable shapes in the eyepiece of a typical amateur instrument.

## **Galaxies**

When observing deep space objects, you literally cannot get any further into "deep space" than by
observing galaxies.  While the objects in our Milky Way galaxy are at most about 100,000 light years
distant, even the *nearest* galaxies are *millions* of light years away!  The most distant
galaxies we can see with typical amateur equipment can be tens of millions of light years away. For
example, M104 (the Sombrero Galaxy) is easily visible in a 6" scope and is nearly 30 million light
years distant.  

Simply grasping the reality that you are looking at a collection of *billions* of stars,
collecting photons that left their parent stars tens of millions of years ago, is truly an
awe-inspiring moment in any astronomer's career, professional or otherwise.

Galaxies can vary in apparent size from very large (M31 has an apparent diameter of over 100
arcminutes) to very small (M60 is just 2 arcminutes across).


## Choosing the Right Telescope

Luckily, choosing the right telescope for DSO observation is pretty easy.  There are really
just three things to consider, in this order: aperture, optical design, and mount.

DSOs are very faint, so to see them, you need to amplify the light they emit to levels where your
retina can register the signal.  There's only one way to do this: bigger optics.  To observe the
entire Messier catalog, you can get by with a 4" scope, but really you'll have better luck and a
more enjoyable experience with a 6" scope or larger.  Commercially manufactured amateur telescopes
get as large as 16", and those with really deep pockets can get custom scopes 32" and even larger!

## **Telescope**

So clearly you want a big scope.  But bigger is not always better, especially when it comes to
factors like portability and ease of use.  There are three basic types of telescopes to consider:
refractors, reflectors, and catadioptric.

**Refractors** are what people tend to think of when somebody mentions a telescope.  It's got a
lens up in the front, and you look through it from the back.  Refractors have no central
obstruction, and so they deliver pinpoint-sharp views of stars.  That means open clusters and
globular clusters really come alive in a refractor.  However, refractors with large apertures are
often prohibitively expensive for most amateurs, and they get even more expensive when you go to
apochromatic models that feature full color correction.  They also require a big heavy-duty mount
due to their size and weight.  Thus, they tend to be somewhat difficult to move around.

**Reflectors** use a mirror to focus light rather than a lens.  Because the focal point
is thus in front of the mirror, a second, angled mirror is required to direct the light to the
side of the tube, near the front of the telescope.  This design is called a "Newtonian Reflector"
after its inventor, Sir Isaac Newton.  Reflectors have a key advantage over refractors in that
it is much less expensive to figure a large mirror to high precision than a large lens.  So
for a given aperture, a reflector is going to be MUCH less expensive than a refractor.  Reflectors
also have the advantage that they focus all frequencies of light to the same place, so they
do not suffer from chromatic aberration like refractors do.  The nature of their design means
that in larger apertures they can usually be broken down into several separate components, making
them easy to transport to your favorite dark sky site.

However, there are some downsides.  First, all Newtonian reflectors suffer from an aberration known
as *coma*.  This aberration appears in the eyepiece as "comet-shaped" stars at the edges of the
field.  The amount of coma is proportional to the distance from the center of the field.  Scopes
with fast focal ratios (f/6 and lower) tend to show coma halfway out from the center of the field,
while slower scopes (f/8 and higher) can keep a sharp image across as much as 90% of the field.
Coma can be corrected in faster scopes using a device such as the Televue Paracorr.  The nature of
Newtonian reflectors (big aperture, eyepiece at the top of the tube) means that design
considerations tend to make them have relatively fast focal ratios.  At 10" and larger, f/4 and f/5
is very common.  They also have a central obstruction from the secondary mirror, which can reduce
contrast and make stars less sharp.  But you probably don't need to worry about this so much;
both of these can be counteracted with more aperture.  Finally, newtonian reflectors require
frequent *collimation* to keep the primary mirror, secondary mirror, and focuser drawtube all
precisely aligned, otherwise the image suffers.

**Catadioptric** telescopes use both lenses and mirrors and feature "folded" optics.  The basic
design takes advantage of the benefits of reflectors (large aperture, lack of chromatic aberration),
and uses some extra elements (coma correcting front lens, convex secondary mirror) to create a
compact, coma-free, long focal length telescope.  While not available in as large of apertures as
Newtonian reflectors, they do come in up to 14" models that are affordable by many amateurs.  They
have many advantages: compact size, light weight, and lack of coma and chromatic aberration.
However, they tend to have narrower fields of view than equivalent aperture refractors and
reflectors, and they take a lot longer to come to thermal equilibrium.  They also require
collimation much like a reflector (but not as often).  They are also more expensive for a given
aperture than a reflector.


## **Mount**

Of the three major types of telescopes, there are many different ways each can be mounted.  How
to choose?  There are three different types of mounts: german equatorial, dobsonian, and fork.

**German equatorial** mounts align one of their rotational axes with the Earth's axis so that
it is possible to track objects by simply driving one axis with a clock drive.  Most models you
will see these days will have drive motors on both axes as well as a hand controller that provides
GOTO capability.  One advantage of equatorial mounts is that they are easy to set up: just aim
the RA axis north, set the latitude, and start observing.  If you choose to use GOTO, the process
is the same, but you also have to go through an alignment process.  Equatorial mounts are also
the ideal platform for astrophotography, if you choose to get into that in the future.  There
are some downsides to an equatorial mount, though.  Their load carrying capacity is fairly small
for the price, and they are heavy to lug around, mostly due to the big counterweights they require.

**Dobsonian** mounts are extremely simple but sturdy mounts pioneered by John Dobson.  His idea
was to bring astronomy to the masses, and he saw the complex and expensive german equatorial mount
as a detractor of this goal.  He designed a simple but sturdy telescope mount designed to carry
Newtonian reflectors.  The mount consists of a *ground board* that acts like a lazy susan,
allowing the telescope to rotate in azimuth (left to right).  On the ground board sits a *rocker
box*, sort of like a "fork" that holds the telescope from its balance point near the center,
and allows the telescope to rotate in altitude (up and down).  That's it -- so simple that pretty
much anybody with a sheet of plywood and some basic hardware could build one, and scalable up to
huge (or tiny) apertures.  The simplicity of the mount also translates to simplicity of use. There
is no aligning to do: just level the ground board, drop the scope into the rocker box, and start
observing.  No need to deal with batteries, clock drives, or celestial coordinates.  The scope
is aimed using simple left-right up-down movements.  The downsides, though, are that the alt-az
motion makes tracking objects (especially at high power) over a long period of time more difficult.
They are also unable to locate targets for you (though there are models that include axis encoders
and a computer locator, and others that even have drive motors and GOTO capability and tracking,
but these features can quickly run up the price).

**Fork** mounts can be half-forks (holds the scope on one side) or full-forks (holds the
scope on both sides).  Fork mounts are most common with catadioptric telescopes.  They can
carry large apertures (though pratically speaking, 14-16" is the largest you'll find for sale),
and most come with drive motors and GOTO capability standard.  They can also be "wedge" mounted,
which aligns the azimuth axis with the Earth's rotational axis so they can gain the advantages
of a german equatorial mount (but without the counterweights).  In all, forks can be a great
compromise between the simplicity and low cost of a dobsonian mount and the complexity, weight,
and high price of an equatorial mount.  However, they do not track quite as well as equatorial
mounts, and they can't carry as large of apertures as dobsonian mounts.  They really only come
with catadioptric scopes mounted, so you won't find them with big newtonian scopes attached.
Some smaller refractors you can find mounted on half-forks, though.  But if you want large
aperture and a fast focal ratio, you probably won't find it on a fork.


## **Best Buys**

So what's the "best" telescope for DSO observation?  That's an awfully tough question to answer.
And so really I won't even try.  What I will say is that when it comes to a "best buy" for a
beginner, you really can't go wrong with a 6-10" dobsonian, such as the Orion XT6, XT8, or XT10.  If
you can afford the "i" series with the computer locator, that's a great upgrade that can make it a
lot easier to find objects, especially under light-polluted skies.  If you start getting into a
dobsonian with drive motors and GOTO, however, you start bumping into pricing that competes with
other types of telescopes, and then it gets really difficult (and very personal) to select the
"right" scope for you.

Just remember that if you're on the fence between two scopes, chances are the one with larger
aperture is the one you probably should get, provided you will be comfortable actually pulling it
out of the closet and setting it up.  A scope that sits in the closet and doesn't get used is the
worst scope of all!


## Choosing the Right Eyepieces

Once you have decided on your telescope (or if you have been given one as a gift), the next
thing you need to do is to obtain a set of eyepieces that will maximize your ability to
observe DSOs with it.  Choosing the right eyepieces requires no prior knowledge about the
design of the telescope, its focal length, or its aperture.  All that you need to know
is the focal ratio (found by dividing the focal length by the aperture).  A 16" f/5
dobsonian will have the same set of recommended eyepieces as a 4" f/5 short tube refractor,
since their focal ratios are the same.

First, let's talk about the *exit pupil*, and how it relates to magnification,
image brightness, and optical clarity.  The exit pupil is the size of the shaft of light
coming out of the eyepiece.  Larger exit pupils equate to lower magnification, and smaller
exit pupils equate to higher magnification.  You can think of the exit pupil in this way:
A telescope's job is to take a bunch of parallel rays of light coming from a target, such
as a star, catch them, and compress them down into a bundle of rays that will fit into
your eye.  By scrunching them together, you land more photons from the target on each
cell in your retina, and thus you are able to see a brighter target than before.  The
size of the exit pupil is the size of that exiting bundle of light rays.

The exit pupil size can be calculated with this simple formula:

**exit pupil = focal length of eyepiece / focal ratio of telescope**

So for example, a 15mm eyepiece used in a f/5 newtonian reflector would result in a 15/5=3mm
exit pupil, while that same eyepiece used in a f/15 maksutov cassegrain scope would result in
a 15/1=1mm exit pupil.  Notice that the exit pupil size scales only with the focal ratio of
the telescope (assuming the eyepiece stays the same).  A 15mm eyepiece in a 5" f/5 reflector
gives a 3mm exit pupil, while that same eyepiece in a monster 24" f/5 Obsession would still
give a 3mm exit pupil.

When looking at eyepieces, most people have a tendency to look at the absolute magnification
first when deciding what to buy.  They know that the magnification is focal length of the
telescope divided by the focal length of the eyepiece, and then tend to look at the specs
for the telescope to see which magnifications are "in range".  Trouble is, looking at absolute
magnifications doesn't take into account things like image brightness, visual acuity, and
human pupil sizes.  Using the exit pupil instead of absolute magnification to determine
the eyepiece focal lengths to use **does** take these into account -- the rest of the factors
(field of view, magnification) will fall into place automatically.

Here is the range of useful exit pupils:


*  5-7mm - minimum magnification.  The human pupil, when dark adapted, can get as large as 7mm (for young observers under very dark skies).  As you get older, your pupils can't expand as large, and if you aren't under pristine dark skies, the ambient light may cause your pupils to not fully dilate.  So 7mm is generally considered to be the maximum exit pupil size, but in reality this could be anywhere from 5-7mm, depending on your age and other factors.  Also consider that your eye has a lens it it as well, that is likely not perfectly figured.  Spreading the light over a larger area of your cornea can cause aberrations like astigmatism to be more noticeable than with smaller exit pupils, which only use a smaller part of your eye lens.  Reference: http://www.rocketmime.com/astronomy/Telescope/MinimumMagnification.html and http://www.rocketmime.com/astronomy/Telescope/SurfaceBrightness.html#Universal
*  2mm - optimum magnification.  As magnification increases, the light for a given area in your field of view gets spread over more of your retina.  Thus, increasing magnification dims stuff in the field (except for stars, which stay as points, and thus maintain their brightness).  Galaxies and nebulae get dimmer as you increase magnification, at the same rate as the background skyglow.  So how can there be an "optimal" magnification?  Well, it turns out that the human eye is able to detect faint objects better if they're larger in size.  But as things get larger, they get dimmer.  It turns out that a 2mm exit pupil is the ideal balance of image scale and brightness to detect faint objects.  Reference: http://www.rocketmime.com/astronomy/Telescope/SurfaceBrightness.html#Opt
*  1mm - maximum magnification.  As the exit pupil shrinks below 1mm in size, the image begins to dim noticeably, and no new detail can be seen.  All you are doing when using an exit pupil smaller than 1mm is magnifying the details that were already there at 1mm; not bringing out new details.  Furthermore, beyond a 1mm exit pupil, stars stop being point sources and begin expanding into Airy patterns, which means they begin to be subject to the effects of dimming with increased magnification.  In other words, faint stars visible with a 1mm exit pupil may not be visible anymore with a .75mm or .5mm exit pupil.  Reference: http://www.rocketmime.com/astronomy/Telescope/MaximumMagnification.html


Keep in mind when choosing eyepieces that you probably want at least one eyepiece for each of these
three exit pupils, and probably a fourth that fills in the middle between your 5-7mm exit pupil and
the 2mm exit pupil.

So what size exit pupils are ideal for which types of objects?


*  Double Stars - 0.5-1mm exit pupil - when trying to split double stars, magnification is the name of the game.  Sure, magnifying beyond a 1mm exit pupil makes the Airy pattern visible, but when splitting tight doubles, often what you're actually looking for is a "lumpy" Airy pattern.  When observing doubles that have a dim partner to a bright primary, super-high magnification can cause the primary to dim (due to it becoming an extended object), which can help detection of the secondary.  Experiment, of course, but you will probably find that splitting tight doubles works best with a very small exit pupil.
*  Globular Clusters - 1mm-2mm exit pupil - Globular clusters are collections of stars, and so increased magnification (up to a 1mm exit pupil) will dim the background sky and make more and fainter stars visible.  Globs tend to be small, with dense cores.  Increasing magnification can help you to resolve more stars at the center of the glob.
*  Open Clusters - 2mm-7mm exit pupil - Open clusters tend to be fairly expansive in size, and thus tend to require lower magnification to fit the entire cluster in the field.  In general, you should try to use enough magnification to just fit the whole cluster comfortably in the field.  The increased magnification will make more stars in the cluster visible, but it has to be balanced with the ability to actually fit the cluster in your field of view.  An eyepiece with a large AFOV can help you to fit larger clusters in the field without giving up the magnification that makes the fainter members visible.
*  Reflection and Emission Nebulae - 2mm-7mm exit pupil - These, like open clusters, tend to be fairly large, and so a lower magnification may be required to fit them in the field.  However, unlike star clusters, increasing magnification will *not* make nebulae easier to see.  As magnification increases, they will get dimmer at the same rate as the background sky, and so you do not increase contrast.  So just try to fit the object comfortably in the field.  You may find that more magnification will reveal some subtle detail, and lower magnifications will frame the nebula nicely among the stars.
*  Planetary Nebulae - 1mm exit pupil - these are tiny, so high magnification is required to see any structure in them, but magnification higher than a 1mm exit pupil will make the nebula unnecessarily fuzzy and difficult to observe.
*  Galaxies - 2mm exit pupil - galaxies are among the faintest objects you'll ever try to observe, so it's crucial to stack as much in your favor as possible.  A 2mm exit pupil will give you the best chance of picking the fuzzy patch out of the background sky.  Some larger galaxies may not fit in the field with a 2mm exit pupil: in those cases you will need to go to a lower magnification (larger exit pupil).


All right -- at this point you should have a good idea of the eyepiece focal lengths that you want,
based on the exit pupils noted above.  For example, if you have an 8" f/6 dobsonian, your "optimal"
2mm exit pupil would be achieved with a 2 * 6 = 12mm eyepiece.  However, if you have a 10" f/4.7
dobsonian, that same exit pupil would be achieved with a 2 * 4.7 = 9.4mm eyepiece.

So what else should you consider other than the focal length of the eyepiece?

**Apparent Field of View (AFOV)**

The AFOV is the apparent size of the field that you see through the eyepiece.  A narrow AFOV makes
it feel like you are observing through a wrapping paper tube, while a wide AFOV can extend the field
well into your peripheral vision, giving you a "spacewalk" experience.

When searching for eyepieces for observing DSOs, generally wider AFOVs are better.  Why?  Well, say
you are purchasing an eyepiece for the 2mm exit pupil slot in your lineup.  The focal length of the
eypiece you want is fixed, and thus so will the magnification when used in your scope.  To ensure you
maximize the amount of sky you'll be able to fit in the field at that particular exit pupil, a wider
AFOV will draw in more sky.

However, some observers find ultra-wide AFOVs to be uncomfortable, as you sometimes have to
physically move your eye around in order to see all the way out to the field stop.  Also, eyepieces
with very wide AFOVs tend to have limited eye relief, and so if you wear glasses at the scope (only
necessary if you have bad astigmatism), you might need to compromise a large AFOV for an eyepiece
with long eye relief.

The most popular wide AFOV eyepieces today have an 82 degree AFOV. Other common widefield eyepieces
are also available with 68/70 degree and 100 degree apparent fields.  Explore Scientific even has a
9mm eyepiece with a whopping 120 degree AFOV.

**Eye Relief**

Eye relief is the distance that your eye must be positioned away from the eye lens in the eyepiece in
order to see the whole field, and to get the best performance from the eyepiece per the designer's
intended specifications.

Eye relief of 5mm is extremely tight, 10mm is bearable, 15mm is comfortable, and 20mm is long enough
for comfortable use with eyeglasses on.

Most premium eyepieces list the eye relief along with the other specifications such as focal length
and AFOV.  However, many simple eyepieces (Plossl, Orthoscopic, Monocentric, etc.) may not list eye
relief.  In that case, the eye relief is often close to the focal length of the eyepiece.  For example,
a 10mm Plossl generally has ~10mm eye relief.

**Spherical Correction**

The eyepiece's job is to magnify the image created by the telescope at its focal plane and present
it to your eye.  Trouble is, the focal "plane" created by the telescope isn't actually flat.
Rather, it is curved.  The faster the telescope (the smaller the f/ ratio), the more curved the
focal plane is.  Simple eyepieces like Plossls are not capable of properly handling highly curved
focal planes.  The result is a visual aberration called *spherical aberration*.  Visually, this
makes stars look "bloated" or out of focus at the edges of the field, while the center of the field
is in focus.  Sometimes you can even tweak the focus knob and get the edges to snap into focus (but
take the center of the field out of focus).  When you hear somebody describing an eyepiece as being
"soft at the edges", this is probably the aberration they are referring to.  The opposite would be
if the stars are "tack-sharp" from edge to edge.

If the telescope you are using has a slow focal ratio (f/8 and up), you can get away with cheaper,
simpler eyepieces like Plossls.  If your scope is fast (f/6 and down), you should look for eyepieces
that are well corrected.  The correction is provided through the use of extra lens elements.
Eyepieces with six or more lenses tend to have good spherical correction (though this is not a
hard-and-fast rule).  Beware that more lenses doesn't necessarily equate to a better view; it's just
a starting point when trying to determine whether an eyepiece will work well in a fast telescope.  A
six-element Celestron XCel-LX will have better spherical correction than a 5-element Super Plossl,
and much better correction than a standard 4-element Plossl.  As a bonus, well-corrected eyepieces
tend to have wider AFOVs.  However, more lens elements means the eyepiece is more expensive, and the
extra air-to-glass surfaces means more potential for internal reflections and ghosting (which
negatively impacts contrast, especially on bright subjects).  Additionally, each lens element can
only transmit ~95-98% of the light encountering it, so more lens elements means less light is
actually making it to your eye.  When trying to observe something that is *juuuuuust* at the
edge of observability, a high quality, simple eyepiece with few lens elements might give you just
enough boost to see it.

Keep in mind, however, that quality eyepiece manufacturers have virtually perfected multi-element
designs such that they give *very* good contrast and light transmission -- don't automatically
assume that a simple eyepiece is "better" than a complex one just because of this one metric. 

**Coatings and build quality**

Your eyepieces are fully half of your telescope's optical system.  A poorly built eyepiece can make
the view through a $15,000 telescope look like a $50 toy, while a well built eyepiece will always
bring out the best of any telescope.  Not to mention that you can keep your eyepieces and use them
with your next, better telescope, so why not buy the best you can afford, so you only have to buy
once?

The two factors to consider when looking at build quality are the physical characteristics and the
coatings.  Companies like Baader Planetarium and Televue use ultra-high-tech (and expensive)
multi-coatings on every lens surface to reduce glare and improve light transmission.  Lower-priced
clones may have the same lens design, but may not have the same sophisticated coatings.  That's not
to say that the eyepieces made by Meade, Celestron, GSO, Orion, and others aren't good quality -- in
fact, often these eyepieces are a fantastic bang for the buck, giving you 80-90% of the quality at
half (or less) the price of the premium ones.

When looking at the physical characteristics, look for features like soft rubber folding eyeguards,
twist-up eyecups, anodized components, blackened lens edges, and waterproofing.  No eyepiece will
have everything, but keep in mind that when comparing two eyepieces that optically may be identical,
sometimes the extra cost is worth it for the "perks" you get with things like a nice twist-up eyecup.

**Barrel diameter (2" vs 1.25")**

A common misconception many beginners have is that 2" eyepieces are "better" than 1.25" eyepieces.
After all, they tend to be more expensive than their 1.25" cousins, and their massive size suggests
that they must be doing *something* better than a comparatively puny 1.25" eyepiece.

Myth: 2" eyepieces collect more light (or provide a brighter image) than a 1.25" eyepiece.

Reality: The brightness of the view you get through the eyepiece is strictly based on the
size of the exit pupil, and the clear aperture of the scope.  A faster scope won't give you a
brighter image in the eyepiece than a slow scope (assuming the same exit pupil size and aperture).
Similarly, a larger eyepiece won't make the image any brighter than a smaller one, assuming the
exit pupil stays the same.

As the focal length of an eyepiece increases, the field stop (the circle at the focal plane where
the eyepiece lets light in) gets larger.  The AFOV of the eyepiece design also has an effect on the
field stop size -- it sort of acts like a "multiplier".  So a 32mm Plossl (with a 50 degree AFOV)
has a 29mm diameter field stop (1.14 inches) -- thus it just barely fits inside a 1.25" eyepiece
barrel (with .1" to spare for the barrel material).  Meanwhile, a 31mm Nagler with an 82 degree AFOV
has a 44.4mm diameter field stop (1.75") that effectively maxes out a 2" eyepiece barrel.

Myth: 2" eyepieces have better optics than 1.25" eyepieces

Reality: Eyepiece manufacturers ship eyepieces in a barrel that makes the most sense for
the optical design.  Long focal length, wide-AFOV eyepieces require field lenses larger than
1.25" and thus must be shipped in a 2" barrel.  For example, the Explore Scientific 82 degree
series is 1.25" in the models up to and including the 14mm.  The 18mm and up ship in 2" barrels.
The 18mm and 14mm are similar focal lengths -- is the 18mm optically superior to the 14mm?  No.
It's just that the field lens is larger than what fits in a 1.25" barrel when you go beyond 14mm
with Explore Scientific's design.

In short, choose your eyepieces based on the factors noted above -- the barrel diameter will follow.


## Choosing the Right Filters

With names like "Light Pollution Reducing" and "Ultra High Contrast", it's often hard to resist the
allure of filters for DSO viewing.  But unfortunately, the marketing material that comes with each
filter tends to hype up the benefits without also talking about the downsides.

The first, and most important thing to know about filters is that they cannot make the object
you are observing any brighter.  In fact, all filters actually make the image *dimmer*
in the eyepiece, because they block portions of the visible spectrum.  However, what filters
can do is to improve *contrast* by dimming the background, but *not* dimming the object
by the same amount, thus increasing the difference and brightness (which is contrast).

Before we dive in, a quick discussion about what we are actually seeing through the eyepiece.
The light arriving at the primary mirror or objective lens of your telescope comes from a
variety of sources: the stars in the field, reflections off of dust clouds, and the dull
glow from ionized gas.  In addition, there is light arriving from local sources, namely 
skyglow (the light that the atmosphere naturally creates on its own), and terrestrial light
(street lamps, headlights, etc.) reflecting off of dust and water droplets suspended in the
air.

Every source of visible light is made up of a set of frequencies, or wavelengths, of light.
You've seen the spectrum of light refracted through a prism before; each color in the spectrum
is a different wavelength.  Shorter wavelengths are to the violet end of the spectrum, while
longer wavelengths are to the red end of the spectrum.

What is interesting about this is that some light sources emit in very specific parts of the
spectrum.  For example, high-pressure sodium vapor floodlights emit over 90% of their light in a
very narrow part of the spectrum, around 590nm.  Mercury vapor floodlights emit most of their
light in three narrow lines: 435nm, 546nm, and 578nm.  Some astronomical objects (emission
nebulae, planetary nebulae) also emit their light in a narrow part of the spectrum.

And this is where filters come in.  There are four basic types of filters:


*  Broadband filters selectively block a few key lines of the spectrum, such as those emitted by mercury vapor and sodium vapor floodlights.  This can help to darken the background by eliminating some of the light generated by terrestrial sources, while still allowing most other light to get through.  Broadband filters are usually marketed as "light pollution reduction" -- Lumicon Deep Sky, Orion Sky Glow, Thousand Oaks LP-1.
*  Narrowband filters are the inverse of a broadband filter.  While broadband filters selectively block certain wavelengths of light, narrowband filters selectively *pass* certain wavelengths.  Generally, narrowband filters pass the range of 484nm to 506nm, and block everything else.  A large class of astronomical objects emit a substantial portion of their light in this segment of the spectrum (the two OIII lines and the H-Beta line) and so these filters can greatly improve visual contrast on these objects while leaving the background inky black.  Common narrowband filters are Lumicon UHC, Orion Ultrablock, and Thousand Oaks LP-2.
*  Line filters are similar to narrowband filters, except that they only pass a single wavelength of light, usually associated with a type of glowing gas.  Typical line filters used in astronomy isolate the OIII, H-beta, and H-alpha lines.  Lumicon, Orion, GSO, and many others make line filters for OIII, H-Beta, and H-alpha.
*  Color filters are sort of like narrowband filters, only they isolate a very broad segment of the spectrum associated with that color.  They are not generally useful for observing DSOs.  One color filter of note, however, is the "CCD Green" filter.  Interestingly, a great deal of astronomical objects emit the majority of their light in the green portion of the spectrum (which contains, among other lines, OIII and H-beta), so a green filter can work somewhat like a broadband filter.


So should you buy a filter?  And if so, what kind?  Dave Knisely does a much better job than I could
describing it, so I'll just link you to his fantastic post: https://www.prairieastronomyclub.org/useful-filters-for-viewing-deep-sky-objects/

Additionally, keep in mind that all filters are not created equal.  In particular, some cheaper
filters have lower light transmission, and some even have bandpasses in the wrong place, making them
practically useless!  Be sure you check reviews and, if possible, independent spectroscopic analysis
of any filter you plan to purchase.  For example, here is an independent spectroscopic review of
some assorted OIII and narrowband filters: http://www.cloudynights.com/item.php?item_id=2129


## The Science of Scotopic Vision (Dark Adaptation)

You have probably heard about "dark adaptation" and how important it is for observing DSOs.  But
what does it mean to be dark adapted?  What are the physiological changes that happen, and what
triggers those changes?  What are the effects of dark-adapted (scotopic) vision?

## **Physiology of the Human Eye**

The human eye operates by focusing light entering through the cornea, through the pupil, and then
through the lens, onto the retina, which has special light-sensitive cells on it.  There are two
kinds of these cells: rods and cones.

Cones are sensitive to color, and are clustered primarily in the center of the retina.  They require
a lot of light to fire, but when they are operating, you can see with a great deal of clarity and
high resolution.  This is because cones are packed very tightly together, so small features can be
resolved easily.  When there is enough light for you to see in color, you are said to be using
"photopic" vision.

Rods are only able to sense grayscale, and are distributed more across the edges of the retina.
They require much less light to fire, and thus are used for seeing in low-light conditions.
However, since they're more spread out, you don't have the same visual acuity (resolution) in low
light as you do in normal light.  When you are using your rods to see, you are said to be using
"scotopic" vision.

One important thing to note about your rods is that the process they use to detect light is through
a chemical reaction.  There is a chemical called *rhodopsin* that slowly builds up in your
rods.  The presence of rhodopsin enhances your rods' sensitivity to light by as much as 1000x, but
it takes some time for the rhodopsin to build up.  Your rods have an auto-protection feature built
in, though.  If bright light enters the eye, the rhodopsin "bleaches" out of the rods, eliminating
the extra light sensitivity.  This allows us to not be blinded during the day, while also being able
to see at night.

For more on the optical theory of observation, see this wonderful site: http://www.rocketmime.com/astronomy/Telescope/telescope_eqn.html

Our goal, then, when dark-adapting, is to maximize the amount of rhodopsin built up in our rods,
and keep it built up, to ensure that we are able to see the faintest amount of light possible.

## **Dark adaptation best practices**


*  Be patient.  It takes a half hour or more to become fully dark adapted.  If you head out from a brightly lit house to your backyard, plunk down in front of the scope, and try to observe a faint fuzzy, chances are you're going to be disappointed.  You need to give yourself plenty of time to get properly dark adapted.
*  Eliminate local bright lights.  Remember the thing about the rhodopsin bleaching out?  Any bright light can do this -- a street lamp, light from a room in the house spilling out into your observing area, or your cell phone/tablet/laptop display.  Do everything you can to eliminate these localized sources of bright light, to ensure you get fully dark adapted.
*  If you need extra light, use a dim, red light.  The most important thing is that it be dim.  The color actually doesn't matter, but convention dictates that it be red, and you really don't want (or need) to get into an argument with another observer regarding the color of your light.  The light you use should be just bright enough to perform a task (like reading a star chart) but no brighter.  Did I mention it should be DIM?  Because yeah, it should be a DIM light.
*  Don't use backlit devices (cell phones, tablets, laptops) while observing DSOs.  Even in "night vision" mode, the screen is still WAY too bright to preserve your dark adaptation.  You *might* be OK with a few layers of red rubylith laid over the screen *and* night vision mode, but is it really worth it at that point?
*  Use paper star charts.  Sky & Telescope's Pocket Sky Atlas is a fantastic chart to use at the scope.  A dim red light will very easily illuminate a paper chart without damaging your scotopic vision.  There's nothing wrong with using technology to help you plan what you want to observe, but once you have the plan made, keep the electronics in your case, powered down.  Your eyes will thank you.
*  Enhance your dark sensitivity at the eyepiece by sitting down.  Sitting while at the eyepiece means your eye sits still, which means the image of your target stays put over the same rods for an extended period of time.  To a small degree, your rods act like the pixels on a CCD chip -- staring for a few seconds can cause some rudimentary "stacking" behavior to happen, increasing your ability to see.
*  Use averted vision.  The center of your visual field is dominated by cones, which are useless in low light.  Your rods are more prevalent in your peripheral vision.  When trying to see detail in a faint fuzzy, try looking off to the side of it.  You will probably notice it get brighter and more detailed when it's not in the very center of your focus.
*  Breathe deeply.  I've heard that breathing deeply increases the amount of oxygen in your bloodstream (and thus your retinas), which enhances your rods' sensitivity.  Personally I haven't noticed a difference, but some do, so you might as well give it a try for yourself.


## **A note about pupil size**

As mentioned in the section above about choosing an eyepiece, the human pupil can open up as wide as
~7mm when fully dark adapted.  But as you get older, your pupil begins to lose some of its
flexibility and can't open as wide.  Seniors may find that their pupils may only open to 4mm or even
less when dark adapted.  Also, bright surroundings (such as those commonly found under heavily light
polluted skies) can prevent the pupil from fully expanding.  Keep this in mind when choosing a
low-power eyepiece: if the exit pupil of the telescope+eyepiece is wider than your pupil has
expanded, then light will fall onto your iris rather than enter the eye.  The result is lost light,
and you effectively stop down your telescope to a smaller size.  If you do a lot of observing from
light polluted areas, or if you are getting older, then you might consider sizing your wide-field
eyepiece with an exit pupil closer to 4mm or 5mm rather than the accepted 'default' of 7mm.


## Light Pollution and Atmospheric Conditions

The bane of every DSO observer (other than clouds) is light pollution.  That yellowish or pinkish
haze that hangs in the air and turns otherwise spectacular DSOs into boring puffballs set on a gray
background.  But what is light pollution?  And are there other ways that the atmosphere can affect
your views?

## **Light Pollution**

Light pollution comes in two flavors: local and regional.

Local light pollution consists of light sources near your observing site that interfere with your
proper dark adaptation.  Common examples are street lights, porch lights, and even car headlights
(if your observing location is near a roadway).  It is important to note that local light pollution
does not directly impact your view through the eyepiece.  What it *does* do, though, is to
make it harder (or impossible) to properly dark adapt.  It can also cause glare and distracting
reflections in the eyepiece.

Regional (or "atmospheric"? I'm just winging it here with these names) light pollution is caused
by a general presense of lights in the area.  You need a lot of lights nearby for them to start
forming a "light dome".  Regional light pollution appears as a noticeable glow in the sky.  It
makes passing clouds visible from the bottom.  Often it can be so bright that you can clearly see
your surroundings and are unable to properly dark adapt.  But most importantly, it appears in
the eyepiece as a contrast-robbing background glow that obscures the objects you're trying to
observe.

Keep in mind that a given location might have one, but not the other, kind of light pollution.
The best spots are those that have neither.  A parking lot in the middle of the desert might have a
bright light illuminating it, but the overall sky is pitch black.  Conversely, you may have an
observing spot that is free of local light pollution, but close enough to a city center that the
whole sky glows yellow from horizon to horizon.

**Measuring light pollution**

It's helpful when discussing light pollution to be able to measure it objectively so that you can
compare notes on equal footing with your fellow astronomers.  It is also useful to be able to denote
the light pollution levels in your observing notebook, so you can compare and contrast what you're
able to see under different skies.

There are three commonly used ways of measuring light pollution levels; each have their pros
and cons.


*  **Limiting Visual Magnitude (LVM)** - This method is a good way of measuring both the light pollution levels and the level of your dark adaptation.  Unfortunately, they get rolled into a single value, so you can't really tell your dark adaptation and the light pollution levels apart.  The method is simple: you find a constellation of stars with known magnitudes, and find the faintest one you can see with direct vision.  For consistency, it helps to use a constellation that is in the same part of the sky each night.  For example, here is a chart for Ursa Minor that can help you find LVM for your site: http://www.satobs.org/image/nmag_guid.gif
*  **The Bortle Scale** - While the LVM method looks and feels objective, the resulting number you get doesn't really help much when trying to describe sky conditions to other astronomers.  A slightly more subjective, but empirically more useful tool, is the Bortle dark-sky scale, published by John Bortle in the February 2001 edition of *Sky & Telescope*.  The scale is numbered from 1 (excellent dark-sky site) to 9 (inner-city sky).  Each of the nine levels of the scale have a paragraph describing the sky brightness that qualifies for that level.  You can read about the Bortle scale on Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bortle_Dark-Sky_Scale. Note that the colors are not from the Bortle scale, but rather from the World Atlas of Artificial Night Sky Brightness.  So saying that you have "Bortle Red" skies is inaccurate -- you have "Bortle class 7" skies, or perhaps WAANSB "red" skies.
*  **Direct measurement** - You can buy a tool called a Sky Quality Meter (http://www.unihedron.com/projects/darksky/) that is able to directly measure the brightness of the sky.  The result it returns is in *magnitudes per square arcsecond*.  This is a completely objective (and useful!) measurement that can help you to determine whether a given object will be observable, by comparing the surface brightness of the object with the brightness of the sky.  If the two values are more than three magnitudes apart, then you'll probably be able to see the object.  Remember that surface brightness is not the same as integrated brightness! (see the "observing techniques" section further down).


**Dealing with light pollution**

Local light pollution is the easiest to deal with.  The main thing that local light pollution is
doing is hurting your dark adaptation.  So if you can block the light from reaching your observing
area, then you can fix that problem.  Many observers set up tarps or curtains to block the light
from neighbors' porch lights or from street lights.  Others keep an eyepatch over their observing
eye so that it stays dark adapted, and only pull the patch away while at the eyepiece.  I often
drape a dish towel over my head while observing from my backyard, to block the stray lights from the
neighbors from interfering with my view through the eyepiece.  Do what you've got to do!

Regional light pollution is another story.  The only way to deal with it is to get away from it (see
the "selecting and utilizing a dark sky location" section below).  But if you can't get out to a
dark-sky site, there are a few things you can try:


*  Observe in the early morning hours before sunrise.  Many businesses turn off exterior lights late in the evening, and there are fewer cars on the road with their bright headlights.  In aggregate across the whole city, this can equate to darker skies than in the early evening just after the sun goes down.
*  Experiment with filters.  Filters aren't a magic solution that makes all your problems go away, but if you are able to properly dark adapt (by eliminating local light pollution) then you might be able to tease out more detail on some objects (notably emission and planetary nebulae) by using a narrowband or line filter.  A LPR filter might help improve contrast on other objects.
*  Choose targets that are easiest to observe under light pollution.  Globular clusters and planetary nebulae are both objects with high surface brightness, which helps them to punch through light pollution.  Since globs are stellar in nature, ramping up the magnification (up to a 1mm exit pupil) makes the background darker, but does not dim the constituent stars.  This improves contrast and makes them easier to observe.  Planetary nebulae respond very positively to narrowband and OIII filters, and also require high magnification.  The combination makes them more observable in light polluted areas.



## **Atmospheric Conditions**

Light pollution is just one of many atmospheric conditions that you deal with when observing.
There are four properties to track, which the Canadian weather office does a great job
of describing: http://www.weatheroffice.gc.ca/astro/index_e.html

Briefly, 

*  **Clouds:** Obviously fewer clouds == more clear sky, and better observing conditions.
*  **Seeing:** How stable the air is.  Poor seeing conditions cause stars to appear to be "boiling" when observed at high power.  Good seeing is most important for observing things that require high power: double stars, planets, globular clusters, and planetary nebulae.
*  **Transparency:** Suspended dust and moisture in the air can scatter light, making light pollution worse and reducing the number of photons arriving at your telescope from the object you're observing.  Good transparency is critical for detailed observation of faint objects like nebulae and galaxies.  With poor transparency you can often still observe other objects effectively though, such as open clusters, double stars, and bright reflection nebulae.


To find the sky conditions in your area and/or your favorite dark sky site, you can use the ClearDarkSky chart: http://cleardarksky.com/csk/ or 7Timer: http://7timer.y234.cn/index.php?product=astro


## Selecting and Utilizing a Dark Sky Location

After reading through all this, you may have become (rightly) convinced that your backyard is not
really the best place to be observing.  You may be dealing with Bortle class 7-9 skies and all kinds
of local light pollution from street lamps and porch lights.  The houses around you create columns
of hot air that make for poor seeing conditions.  And the trees and buildings around you limit your
view of the sky.  So what do you do to get out to the "good stuff" under pristine dark skies?

The first thing I recommend is that you search for an astronomy club in your area.  Just hop over to
Google and search for "your_city astronomers" and see what pops up.  Astronomy clubs generally have
a dark sky site that they use (or even own), and will be happy to have you join their ranks.  This
is the "fast track" way to dark sky -- let the folks that have been doing it for years do the
hunting for you!  As a side benefit, you'll have access to other astronomers so you can bounce
questions off of them, try out equipment they bring to star parties, and even get access to club
resources like loaner scopes, charts, and eyepieces.

However, if the astronomy club hunt is a bust, or the site that they use is too far out of the way
for it to be useful for you, then you may need to strike out on your own and locate your own spot.
This can be a daunting challenge, but it's not impossible!  Here are some tips and resources for
finding a great dark sky spot.

First, establish your goals, and the priority of those goals.  There's bound to be trade-offs when
you start locating potential observing sites.  For example, "nearby, darkest sky, free to use...
pick two".  Not that it's always going to be like this, but it will serve you well in your hunt to
ensure you've carefully considered what's most important to you, so that you can properly rank the
sites you locate.

To start, use the dark sky finder: http://www.jshine.net/astronomy/dark_sky/  The data is a little
old, but should be good enough that you can at least see the general regions around you that have
dark sky.  You may even find that there are already pins placed in the map in areas you are
interested in, where other astronomers have registered an observatory or observing site.  Use this
site to identify a few key areas that you wish to narrow your search.  The dark sky finder uses the
World Atlas of Artificial Night Sky Brightness colors, which you can (loosely) cross-reference with
the Bortle dark sky scale here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bortle_Dark-Sky_Scale The Bortle
designations can help you to get a feel for how "deep" you'll be able to go at a given site, based
on the colors on the map.

Next, visit Google Maps (http://maps.google.com) or perhaps use Google Earth
(http://www.google.com/earth/index.html) to "fly" around your potential observing areas.  You're
hunting -- looking for parking lots, trail heads, pastures, turnouts, or anything else that might be
a good spot to observe.  As you find potential spots, jot down the locations.  I like to use Google
Maps' "my maps" feature to track my locations.  Here is my dark sky research map:
https://maps.google.com/maps/ms?msid=215229748952834812071.0004b233ee49334ff22a1&msa=0

Now that you have some potential spots located, you'll need to do some reconnaissance.  During the
day, drive by your potential spots.  For each site, check for:


*  Legal to use: Respect "no trespassing" and "do not enter" signs.  Don't cross fences.  If there are gates, assume you're not supposed to go in there, unless it is explicitly noted otherwise.  National parks are often great places to observe, but be sure you are following the rules.  Do you need to buy an overnight pass?  Are you allowed to stay after sundown?
*  Accessible: Are you able to safely get your car/truck into and out of the site?  Do you think you'll be able to get in and out safely at night?  If there are narrow roads, is there somewhere to turn your car around?  You don't want to be backing down a narrow dirt road in the pitch dark...
*  Safe: Will you be secure in the location?  Do you get cell phone coverage?  How far away is the nearest 24-hour market?  How about a local fire station or police station?  It's unlikely that you'll need it, but when deciding on your dark sky site, remember that you're going to be there alone, and so something as seemingly trivial as slipping and falling could really escalate quickly if you don't have access to emergency services (or at least a cell phone signal).
*  Dark: Is it really dark there?  There may be sites that *seem* like they'd be perfect.  For example, on my map you can look at the "Sunrise Highway" location.  It looks great -- high elevation, near a university observatory, with a large clearing/turnout that provides plenty of room to safely get off the road and set up the scope.  But after trying the site one night, I found it wasn't as great as I thought.  Cars driving up and down the road would constantly shine their headlights over the observing area.  And the site, due to the high elevation, looks over a city below.  The combination of the cars and the city lights combine to effectively thwart efforts to fully dark adapt.  However, it does have an unfettered view of the western horizon, which makes it an ideal location to observe targets that only appear in the early evening low on the horizon.


Once you have selected a site, and find that it is a good one, share it!  If you know astronomers in
your area, share your knowledge with them.  You may find that after a while you can build up an
astronomy club of your very own, just by virtue of coordinating trips to your newfound dark-sky
site.  Bringing more people with you (especially when they come in multiple vehicles) greatly
reduces the risk of becoming stranded, and having other folks with you can be a lot of fun!

The last thing I'll leave you with in this section is a checklist of items I bring with me to my
dark-sky site.  Your list will vary, but if you don't know where to start, this will at least get
you going:


*  Telescope OTA
*  Finder
*  Eyepiece case
*  Accessories case (anti-vibration pads, laser pointer, Leatherman multi-tool, collimation wrenches, collimation tool(s), magnetic compass, extra batteries, a few [Zeiss Lens Cleaning Wipes](http://www.amazon.com/Zeiss-Pre-Moistened-Lens-Cloths-Wipes/dp/B0030E4UIQ), pen, pencil, notepad)
*  Mount, counterweights, tripod
*  Battery
*  Charts
*  Dim red light (as a headlamp or on a lanyard so you don't misplace or drop it)
*  Mag-Lite (for a final scan of the area after observing to make sure you don't leave anything)
*  Electric/Wool socks
*  Wool cap
*  Sweatshirt(s)
*  Long johns/ski bib
*  Heavy coat (you should be dressing for ~20 degrees F colder than the "low" listed in the forecast)
*  Gloves
*  Bug spray
*  Thermos of hot tea
*  Water
*  Snacks
*  Kleenex (both for the nose and *just in case* you have to "pop a squat" in the woods)
*  Folding table (for charts and eyepiece case)
*  Observing chair (a drum throne is an inexpensive and quite portable solution if you're short on space)



## Observing Techniques

Visual observing, to a large degree, is more of an art than a science.  I say that because it takes
practice, finesse, and sometimes, a gut instinct, to do it well.  Beginners are rarely able to just
walk up to a telescope for the first time and see the with the same clarity, depth, and detail as an
experienced veteran.

So more than anything, be patient with yourself.  Be persistent and get your scope outside whenever
you can, and practice!  You'll be pleasantly surprised that it gets to be easier and easier, and
that you start to see more and more.

As you work your way up the learning curve, here's a list of things to try to help you refine your
technique.

## **Make a plan**

It really helps you to relax when you've got a plan.  Ad-hoc observing sessions tend to be frought
with frustration.  What's the best thing to observe tonight?  Is there anything that is about to
be below the horizon for the rest of the year?  Are there any really interesting conjuctions
occurring?  All of these questions will be running through your head while you are at the scope.
And even as you do get new objects lined up in the eyepiece, in the back of your head you'll be
constantly thinking, "maybe there's something better to look at??"

So -- make a plan!  It doesn't have to be super-complex...perhaps just open up Stellarium and
jot down a few objects you want to observe.  Many astronomy applications (particularly those
for your tablet and phone) have a "what's up" feature that can help you pick out a few objects
to observe (but leave the phone/tablet turned off while outside with the scope!)

For a complete discussion of developing an observing plan, see below.  For now, just keep in mind
that having a plan -- even just a scrap of paper with 4 or 5 objects listed -- can make you 
more relaxed at the scope.  And a more relaxed observer is a better observer!

## **Locating objects**

Locating objects can be tough.  There's a LOT of sky up there, and in many cases the object
you're trying to find is REALLY small.  And even worse, the object is often just barely
visible.

So other than just punching in the objct number in your handbox and letting GOTO do the work,
how do you find objects?

First, I strongly urge you to get a Telrad, or a Rigel QuickFinder, or any other kind of
"unit power reflex sight finder".  Frankly, I think the Telrad is the best of the bunch,
and at USD $40 is quite a bargain.  The Telrad is an indispensable tool for helping you to find
objects. It, along with a good set of charts (I recommend the Sky & Telescope Pocket Sky Atlas) is
sufficient to locate pretty much everything in the Messier catalog, and then some!

The trick is practice -- there's a number of different strategies for finding objects when using a
Telrad + 8x50 finder. Here's two that I commonly use:

**1. Dead reckoning**

With this method, you look at your chart (it helps to make a Telrad "template" from a sheet of
transparency paper so you can overlay the Telrad rings on the chart) and center the object in the
Telrad rings. Look at neighboring bright stars and try to fix their positions in your mind. For
example, the outer ring may be just to the "left" of a bright star, or something like that.

Then swing your scope around and position the Telrad bulls-eye as best you can emulate from the
charts. This will generally get the object at least within the field of your finder, where you
can then adjust to center the object, and switch to a low-power eyepiece in the scope.

This method is described in the O'Reilly book "Telescope Hacks": http://tiketov.net/astronomyhks-chp-2-sect-11.html

**2. Star hopping**

If dead reckoning doesn't work, then you have to star hop. But luckily, you can probably use the
dead reckoning process to at least position the scope in the general vicinity of your target, then
switch to your 8x50 finder. In the finder, you'll be able to see more stars, and should then be able
to follow unique patterns and shapes of stars from one defined spot to another, until you arrive at
your target.

There is a pretty well thought out video series about star hopping on YouTube:

*  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceXB_KMjj9k
*  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhoUWqUM9H8


You might also read through the Wikipedia article: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_hopping


## **Have a seat and take your time**

It's tough to over-emphasize the importance of sitting while you observe.  Not only does 
sitting save your back and neck from strain, the stability you get at the eyepiece equates
to seeing more of those faint fuzzies.  It's often said that just having a seat is like
adding 2" of aperture to your scope!

What are your options for chairs?


*  [Drum throne:](http://www.amazon.com/b?ie=UTF8&node=11966931) portable and sturdy.  But often has a limited range of height adjustment.  This can be a drag when using a refractor, where the eyepiece can move up and down by a large amount.
*  [LYBAR chair:](http://www.stark-labs.com/craig/lybar/lybar.html) simple and inexpensive to construct yourself.  Gives you three different height options.  Might be difficult to pack in a car, though.
*  [Denver Observing Chair:](http://www.tulsawalk.com/projects/denverobserverchair/index.html) Wide range of height adjustments, and relatively lightweight considering its size.  Rear support sticks waaay back, so you need a lot of room around your scope.
*  [CATSPERCH Chair:](http://www.catseyecollimation.com/cperch1.html) Locking notches behind the seat keep it from sliding down unexpectedly.  More compact than the Denver chair, but arguably a bit less stable, especially at high seat settings.


In all cases, you are encouraged to try your hand at building your own if you don't feel like
buying.  Heck, even an overturned 5 gallon bucket or milk crate might be all you need to get into a
comfortable position at the scope.  Get creative!  But whatever you do, have a seat.

## **Eliminate stray light around your eyes**

While observing, you'll be surprised how much of a difference it makes, even under dark sky, to
shield your eyes.  While sitting in front of the eyepiece, lower your observing eye over the
eyelens.  Once you have the field in view, put both hands up around your face, like blinders.  The
natural tendency is to cup your hands closely around your eye -- you want to avoid this, because you
don't want your hands resting on the telescope itself (that would introduce vibrations).  Instead,
just try to "float" over the eyepiece, with your hands on the sides of your face to block the stray
light.  You might find that the contrast level improves noticeably.

## **Use long gazes and averted vision**

Once you have your target in sight through the eyepiece, really take some time to study it
carefully.  Spend at least 60 seconds at the eyepiece soaking in the view.  Carefully scan over the
whole surface of the object with direct vision.  What can you see?  Are some spots darker than
others?  Can you trace the perimeter of the object?

Now avert your gaze 15-20 degrees to the side of the object, while still focusing on it mentally.
You'll immediately notice the object appear brighter, possibly with more detail.  Spend some more
time observing the object with averted vision.  Try moving your gaze closer to and further away from
the object.  Is there a "sweet spot" where you can see the most?

By now you should have spent at least 120 uninterrupted seconds at the eyepiece.  Take a few deep
breaths, blink a few times, stretch your neck, and do it all again.  You may see even more the
second time around!

## **Keep a logbook**

As you observe, it is a great idea to keep a log book.  The log entries don't have to be novels:
just keep an organized log of your attempted and successful observations.  Often just a couple lines
in a college-ruled notebook is sufficient. 

There are a few items that you can jot down just once, as you begin the session:

*  Date
*  Location
*  Weather/sky conditions (clouds, transparency, seeing, temperature, humidity, moon phase)
*  Telescope(s) being used


And for each object you attempt to observe,

*  Object name/number
*  Magnification(s) used (or eyepieces if you prefer)
*  Filter(s) used (if applicable)
*  A brief 1-3 sentence description of the object, with emphasis on observable detail and structure.  If you were unable to locate the object, note this as well.


By keeping a logbook, you can monitor your progress over time.  It also gives you a way to track
information that is otherwise easy to forget.  For example, when making an observing plan, you might
not remember whether you've seen M36 yet.  Was it M37?  I know it was in Auriga, but which one?
Well, you can go back to your log book and find out.  And furthermore, you will be able to look up
the circumstances around that last observation.  Was it washed out and boring due to the light
pollution?  Perhaps it's worth a revisit if you're heading out to your dark-sky site.

## **Try sketching**

In addition to keeping a log book, many amateur astronomers sketch the DSOs that they observe.  The
rigor required to transfer what you see in the eyepiece to a piece of paper demands a great deal
more attention to what you are seeing in the eyepiece.  And this very fact, regardless of how
realistic your sketches end up looking, is a benefit.

My logbook has a 2" diameter circle next to each log entry.  I don't sketch everything that I
observe, but having it right there in the log book is really handy for those that I do.  And keeping
the sketch in the logbook can help even more when going back to previous observations to see if you
did, indeed, see more detail this time than last time.

You don't need fancy tools to sketch, either.  You can make perfectly great sketches with just a
fine felt-tip pen (for plotting stars) and a standard No. 2 pencil.  If you find you enjoy
sketching, you could upgrade to a set of artists' pencils, or possibly even charcoal.

Whatever you do, have fun!

## **Understand Integrated brightness, Surface brightness, and Contrast**

When looking through a list of potential targets, and while at the eyepiece, it is important
to have a grasp of the optical principles of integrated brightness (the total amount of
light coming from an object), its surface brightess (the brightness of a single "spot"
on the object's surface), and contrast (how much brighter the object appears than the
background).

Understanding these factors, and how they vary for different objects, can help you to
make good decisions regarding the eyepiece to use when observing an object, as well as
selecting the right time and location to maximize the chance that you'll have an enjoyable
experience observing.

Rather than try to paraphrase Tony Flanders' fantastic write-ups on these topics, I'll
just link you to them.  Both of these articles are absolutely worth the read:


*  http://mysite.verizon.net/vze55p46/id18.html
*  http://mysite.verizon.net/vze55p46/id1.html


I'll quote Tony here to emphasize the importance of understanding how brightness works
at the scope:


A great deal of confusion ensues from the fact that amateur astronomers habitually fail to specify
whether they mean integrated brightness or surface brightness when they say that an object is bright
or faint. Consider, for instance, M33, the Triangulum Galaxy. At magnitude 5.7, it is fifth in
integrated brightness of any galaxy in the sky, after our own Milky Way, the two Magellanic Clouds,
and M31, the Andromeda Galaxy. Nonetheless, M33 is referred to as a faint galaxy, because its light
is spread out over a huge area -- nearly a square degree -- giving it one of the lowest surface
brightnesses of any Messier object. On the other hand, the planetary nebula M76 has one of the
highest surface brightnesses of any nebulous Messier object, but it is often called faint because of
its low integrated brightness. (For mathematicians, the term integrated brightness refers to the
integral of the surface brightness over the object's area, which in the case of M76, is tiny.)

To make matters worse, amateur astronomers frequently use the term brightness to mean both
integrated brightness and surface brightness in the same paragraph, and also often use it to denote
the subjective impression of brightness, which depends both on surface brightness and on integrated
brightness. Thus, the galaxy M33 and the globular cluster M13 have almost identical integrated
brightness, but M13 appears much brighter both to the naked eye and through any optical instrument
because its light is concentrated in a smaller area, i.e. because it has a higher surface
brightness. But M13 also appears much brighter than the globular M28, which has almost identical
surface brightness, because M13 is much bigger, and so has higher integrated brightness.



## DSO Catalogs, Star Charts, and Software Tools


## **DSO Catalogs**

If you are just starting out, you might feel a bit overwhelmed.  There are literally *thousands*
of objects visible in a typical amateur class telescope.  It takes years of careful and methodical
observation to even make a dent in that list.  So where do you start?  How do you decide what to
observe this *year*, much less tonight?

Luckily, there are veteran astronomers that have done a lot of this work for us already, by creating
*catalogs* of objects.  Sometimes the catalogs have a theme (like the Struve catalog, which tracks
double stars, or the Arp catalog, which tracks irregular galaxies).  Other catalogs are simply collections
of "pretty" things to look at.

Each catalog generally assigns a catalog-specific designator to each objects.  Generally this catalog-specific
designator is cross-referenced to at least the New General Catalog (NGC), which is, for the purposes
of amateur astronomers, the *de facto* clearing house for all observable DSOs.

It's handy to have a set of catalogs at your fingertips when planning observations.  For example,
let's say you're planning a trip to a very dark site.  You'll probably want to look for a catalog
that lists objects that you may not be able to see from light polluted skies (such as the Caldwell
or Arp catalogs).  If you just got a shiny new APO refractor, you might browse through the Struve
catalog and look for colorful doubles to split.

I present to you here a few catalogs that I've found handy.  It's by no means complete or authoritative,
it's just a place to start.

**Messier Catalog** - http://messier.seds.org/

From the SEDS site:

[quote]
During the years from 1758 to 1782 Charles Messier, a French astronomer (1730 - 1817), compiled a
list of approximately 100 diffuse objects that were difficult to distinguish from comets through the
telescopes of the day. Discovering comets was the way to make a name for yourself in astronomy in
the 18th century -- Messier's first aim was to catalog the objects that were often mistaken for
comets.
[/quote]

One of the great things about the Messier catalog that makes it so popular is that because it was
compiled so long ago, on (by today's standards) such primitive telescopes, most of the objects in
the catalog are visible using equipment well within the reach of an amateur astronomer.  The majority
of the catalog can even be observed using a 10x50 binocular!

Plus, the list is relatively short (110 objects) and so it is not a monumental task to work through
the entire catalog over the course of a year or two.  But it is actually possible to observe the
entire catalog in a single evening -- these events are called [Messier Marathons](http://messier.seds.org/xtra/marathon/marathon.html).

**Caldwell Catalog** - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caldwell_catalogue

From the Wikipedia page:

[quote]
The Caldwell Catalogue is an astronomical catalog of 109 bright star clusters, nebulae, and galaxies
for observation by amateur astronomers. The list was compiled by Sir Patrick Caldwell-Moore, better
known as Patrick Moore, as a complement to the Messier Catalogue.
[/quote]

The Caldwell catalog is a great place to start once you have exhausted the Messier catalog for things
to see.  It, too, is a short list, and can be worked through in a year or two of dedicated observing.

**Herschel Catalog** - http://obs.nineplanets.org/herschel/h2500.txt

From http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalogue_of_Nebulae:

[quote]
The Catalogue of Nebulae and Clusters of Stars was first published in 1786 by William Herschel in
the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London.[1] In 1789, he added another 1,000
entries., and finally another 500 in 1802, bring the total to 2,500 entries.
[/quote]

This is a *massive* catalog.  In the eighteenth century, this was one of the major efforts to
catalog *everything* visible in the sky under a single catalog.  It is so big, however, that
it's often broken up into smaller chunks.  The
[Herschel 400](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herschel_400_Catalogue) is a subset of the full
Herschel catalog compiled by Brenda F. Guzman (Branchett), Lydel Guzman, Paul Jones, James Morrison,
Peggy Taylor and Sara Saey of the Ancient City Astronomy Club in St. Augustine, Florida, USA in
around 1980.  It identifies the 400 "best" objects in the Herschel catalog.  It overlaps quite a few
items in both the Messier and Caldwell catalogs.

**Astroleague Catalogs** - [Observing Clubs](http://www.astroleague.org/al/obsclubs/EquipmentObservingClubs.html)

The Astronomical League is a worldwide society devoted to promoting the science of astronomy.  One
of their many efforts has been to create a series of "clubs" that each consist of a series of
"programs".  Each of these programs is a catalog of sorts -- a series of observing challenges that,
if accomplished, is rewarded with a certificate and a "badge" of sorts.

It is not necessary to join Astroleague to get access to their observing lists.  These catalogs
are an excellent resource for beginners who do not want to get frustrated trying to observe objects
that are not suited to either their light pollution levels or their equipment.

**Struve Catalog** - http://www.astronomyforum.net/general-stargazing-forum/93453-complete-struve-catalog-double-star-abbreviations-other-double-star-info.html

This is a catalog of double stars.  If you love splitting doubles, this one is for you.

**Arp Catalog** - http://arpgalaxy.com/

This catalog compiles irregular and unusual galaxies.  Many (if not all) are challenging in typical
amateur equipment -- you need a pretty big scope to observe these visually.  But if you are doing
astrophotography, this could be a great catalog for locating interesting things to image

**RASC Observer's Handbook** - http://www.rasc.ca/handbook

This isn't a catalog, *per se*, but it is an indispensable resource for an amateur astronomer
wishing to learn more of the science of astronomy.  The handbook includes ephemera for the year,
including tides, moon phases, planetary positions, conjunctions, eclipses, occultations, asteroid
passes, and star charts.  It also includes an entire section with scholarly papers written by
professional astronomers and astrophysicists.  The 2012 edition, for example, included a fantastic
paper by Roy Bishop about the science behind how exit pupils affect your view through a telescope.

In the back of the book are a series of observing lists, sorted and compiled specifically for
North American observers.  Some of these lists, such as "Finest NGC objects" and "Deep Sky Gems"
are excellent resources when planning an observing session.


## **Star Charts**

As I have mentioned many times in this treatise, using electronic tools (smart phone, tablet,
laptop) while at the scope is a recipe for frustration, mostly due to the ease with which
these devices can rob you of your hard-won dark adaptation.  Using a paper star chart and
a dim red light is (in my opinion) a much better way to navigate the skies while at the 
scope.

There are many star charts with various pros and cons, but I'll try to summarize the ones
I am familiar with here.

**Sky & Telescope's Pocket Sky Atlas** - This is a fantastic atlas in that it's compact,
spiral-bound, and rugged.  It isn't the most detailed chart, but really hits a lot of sweet
spots when observing.  You can work through the entire Messier and Caldwell catalog with
just this atlas at your side, if you choose.

**Sky & Telescope's Sky Atlas 2000.0** - The big brother of the Pocket Sky Atlas.  If
you have a PSA and want to go "deeper", this is a great atlas, because the symbols, markup,
fonts, and everything else you're used to in the PSA, will be the same in this atlas, just
"zoomed in" further, and with fainter stars plotted.

**Uranometria 2000.0 Sky Atlas** - Goes even deeper than the S&T Sky Atlas.  It goes so
deep that it actually comes in three volumes!

**[The Triatlas Project](http://www.uv.es/jrtorres/triatlas.html)** - This is a free
atlas that you can download.  It comes in three volumes.  The "A-set" is a broad view that
sits somewhere between the PSA and the S&T Sky Atlas.  The "B-set" goes even deeper, and
finally the "C-set" goes all the way down to magnitude 12.4.  If you can't afford a big
professionally bound atlas, you can at least print off a page or two from the Triatlas
before each observing session to give yourself a map.


## **Software Tools**

Given that astronomy is a science, it should be no surprise to discover that there is
a wealth of excellent software available to assist you in various aspects of the
field.  You might be able to put web sites under this category as well, but I will
refrain from doing so -- see the "Links and Resources" section at the end for those.

**Stellarium** - http://www.stellarium.org

A fantastic planetarium program.  Notice I didn't call it a "chart generation" or
"observation list generation" tool.  Stellarium's purpose is more to be a realistic
simulation of what it's like to stand outside and look up at the sky, than it is
a "charting" tool.  However, despite that, it is immensely useful for predicting
when objects will be visible, in which part of the sky.  And the Oculars plugin
can give you a real-time peek at how different telescope and eyepiece combinations
will frame your target.  You can even control your computerized telescope with it.

One great thing about Stellarium is the ease with which you can customize it. Two
customizations I have made have been to add custom landscapes and to add a new
"Skyculture" that draws the constellations using the Sky & Telescope figures.
You are welcome to use both!

*  http://www.astronomyforum.net/astronomy-software-forum/144923-updated-sky-telescope-skyculture-stellarium.html


**Cartes du Ciel** - http://www.ap-i.net/skychart/start

This software is more along the lines of what you'd expect from a "chart generation"
tool.  It doesn't try to simulate the view of the night sky, but rather gives you
a powerful interface for locating, researching, and plotting the locations of objects.

**The Sky** - http://www.bisque.com/sc/pages/TheSkyX-Professional-Edition.aspx

A limited/trial edition of this software is often bundled with new telescopes.  It's actually
pretty nice software, bridging the gap between a "planetarium" program like Stellarium and
a "charting" program like Cartes du Ciel.  It's a professional-grade piece of software
that isn't free, but doese have everything in it you might need to control your high-end
robotic astrophotography rig.

**Software Forum** - http://www.astronomyforum.net/astronomy-software-forum/

Software is constantly changing and improving.  If you discover some great new software,
or want to discuss it, visit this forum's software section and post a new thread!


## Planning an Observing Session

Planning an observing session is an intensely personal experience.  It's literally all about you.
What do *you* want to observe?  What are your priorities?  Do you prefer constellation sweeping
or bagging Messiers?  Or both?  Do you prefer globs over open clusters?  Do you really love hunting
for planetaries?  The best I can do in this section is to describe how I plan my observing sessions.
You are encouraged to modify this process, or simply shake your head and wonder why I do it this
way.  It's all good!

You can read the full thread where I posted this here: http://www.astronomyforum.net/astronomy-software-forum/141819-planner-software.html

First, I use Stellarium, adjusting the date/time and location (using [custom landscapes](http://www.astronomyforum.net/astronomy-software-forum/138481-creating-custom-landscapes-stellarium.html) to ensure I
have an accurate horizon) to see which constellations are going to be visible in ideal positions
over the period of my observing session.

Next, I skim through the previous, current, and next month's issues of Sky & Telescope to see if
there are any particularly interesting sights they recommend. Sue French's column tends to have
really great recommendations.

Then, I use the [constellation sweeps guide](http://www.cloudynights.com/category.php?category_id=170)
to augment the list with neat objects in the constellations I'm focusing on. Finally, a
pass through the [monthly Messier list](http://observers.org/observing/) and the [urban and suburban Messier guide](http://mysite.verizon.net/vze55p46/id10.html) rounds out the list with Messier objects.

My list at this point is disorganized -- just a collection of targets, types (glob, open cluster,
galaxy, etc.), and constellations. The last step is to create the actual observing plan.

I start by visiting [CalSky](http://www.calsky.com/) to find out when sunset and astronomical
twilight will be. If the Moon is
going to be up during the session, this also tells me when that will be. This helps me to set
parameters around the beginning and end of the observing session. I also use CalSky to identify
interesting phenomena, for example Iridium flares, visible supernovae, and interesting planetary
events like transits or occultations of Jupiter's moons.

Finally, it's time to build the final observing list. I use the times from CalSky to establish a
"dusk" period (when the only targets I select are planets and the Moon), followed by the "dark"
period, which is split into hour-long chunks. For each hour-long chunk, I set Stellarium for that
time, and then based on the position of the constellations relative to my horizon and the zenith,
select four or five targets from my big list for that hour. I try to keep the objects within a given
hour all in the same region of the sky, so that I don't have to move my observing chair around too
much. Repeat for each hour-long chunk of time.

Each entry in the observing list contains the following pieces of information:


*  Identifier (Messier number, NGC number, IC number, etc.)
*  Name (if applicable)
*  Type (GAL, OCL, GCL, RNEB, ENEB, PNEB, etc.)
*  Constellation
*  Pocket Sky Atlas chart number


Often I will also make a note (or make bold) on objects that I want to pay particular attention to,
for example new Messier objects that I want to record as I keep working toward my M70 award.

Finally, I go through my PSA and use [Post-It arrow flags](http://www.officedepot.com/a/products/395971/Post-it-Arrow-Flags-12-Assorted/) to mark the location of objects that I'm
not already familiar with the location. This can be a HUGE time saver out in the field, as you don't
have to hunt all over the chart looking for that tiny green circle marking the PNEB you're hunting.

I find this process rewarding and effective because it's a multi-phased approach that takes a long
list of potential objects and carefully whittles them down into an achievable list of things that I
really do want to see. Sites like Tonight's Sky tend to generate massive volumes of data that I find
to be overwhelming for use when planning observing sessions. I'd much rather select four great
objects to observe in an hour, than to have a list of 100 potential objects, of which 90 may be too
faint to see, or turn out to be behind a tree. And reading through the sites I linked above gives me
some context and background on the objects I'm observing, so it makes the experience that much more
rewarding.

When out in the field, I prefer to find targets manually (without GOTO). This is strictly a personal
preference. I don't use any electronic aids (no iPhone apps, no laptop, no tablet) while at the
scope: it's just me, my Telrad, my 9x50 finder, and my PSA (and maybe some detailed charts printed
from the TRIATLAS project). I find that the 4/hour observation rate is sufficient to keep me
busy all night, and in fact I often have to skip objects on the list because I get behind.
